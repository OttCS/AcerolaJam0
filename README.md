I'm participating in Acerola's Game Jam 0! Let's hope I get this done

# Tech
I'm using [PixiJS V8](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs) (Renderer) + [ZephyrJS](https://github.com/ZephyrStudio/ZephyrJS) (Engine). Want to learn more? They're both linked to their respective GitHub repos!

I'm avoiding any 3D rendering, just projecting flat textures and layering them properly to look like voxels. Idk it works for me and for performance in-browser.
