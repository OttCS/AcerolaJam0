An overview breakdown of the different levels in the game!

## Mechanics
1. Enemies that attack if you go too close to them
2. Carnivorous plants
3. Floors that crumble
4. Lever? It does lever things


# Level One
**Welcome to the Jungle**

The player walks through a crack in a walled city, The Wilds before them. Foreboding and overgrown, it features a few shadowy things that lurk around the edges of view, and introduces the player to simple enemies.

# Level Two
**Welcome to Loreville**

The player comes across some ruins, which show/tell the expansion of The Wilds after "sheer fucking hubris" through environmental storytelling (or something lmao). First "twist" and "test" of simple enemies.

# Level Three
**Feed me Seymour**

The aberrations take many forms, and this time it's corrupted nature. Carnivorous plants comes into play! The twist/test comes in here too, revealing that they'll attack pretty much anything that reaches them, including other enemies.

# Level Four
**The Temple**

Combine all of the mechanics! Puzzle your way through an old, buried and collapsed temple compound and discover what's been creating the aberrations.
