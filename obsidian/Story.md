# Story
What the player should learn about the world they're in.

# Overall
The world should focus on the aberrations of The Wilds: an unchecked jungle that seems to conjure dangerous creatures that never existed. Small hints should be dropped here and there, perhaps the ruins of more modern civilization grown through showing the expansion of The Wilds, and even older ruins showing the worship of a "Great Old One" style nature deity.
